## At Home

* Do you encourage hand-washing standards (e.g. wash for 20s)?
* Child(ren) doing online school, or not?
    * Hiring a tutor to facilitate learning/school?
* Options for collective childcare?
* Organize social circle outdoor educational activities for the kiddos (e.g. talent show in the back yard, etc.)?

## In Public
* Do you go to summer camps? Gyms? Group activities? Sports?
