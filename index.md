## Welcome to Connecting the Village Co-op
Children's social development is a key component of their mental wellness. Different ages present different requirements for social interaction and development. As parents of grade-school age kids, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our kids' social lives and adds additional stressors to their everyday lives.

* **Unknowns about school / academic clubs / etc?** You bet.
* **Continuing / transitioning to online learning?** Probably / yes.
* **Not sure how to talk to other families about "getting the kids together"?** You bet.
* **One or both parents working/going to school/etc, and are having a hard time figuring out childcare?** You bet.

YOU ARE NOT ALONE! It's time to take action on behalf of our kids, and create a "new normal", rather than waiting on others (e.g. school) to facilitate it for us.

Another tool created by others in the open source community, the [Covid Childcare Co-op Calendar](https://childcarecoop.org/) (CCCC), shares very similar inspiration and opinions. We believe the CCCC can complement the Connecting the Village Co-op Framework. Check them out!

### What does this site do for me?
This website hosts a free, open source, and continuously-improving framework (thank you, open source community!) designed to facilitate parents with communicating with each other about COVID-19 impacts on their kids' social lives.

### Framework Overview
The Connecting the Village Co-op Framework consist of the documents below:

* [**Glossary**](./glossary): A set of terminology and their definitions.
* [**Common Expectations**](./expectations): A worksheet that should be used by the social circle.
* [**Conversation Helpers**](./conversation-helpers): This is a set of questions that you can use to help facilitate trust and a dialog with the other families in your social unit.

Supplemental Google Docs documents are available, too:

* [**Discussion Log**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lqhWSFqF3ubKfmc_7wNYLg8bs7FMEFHUQ69n10_wlw/edit?usp=sharing): Use this with other parents in your social circle to document your conversation / decisions. We encourage you to copy and keep it as your own Google doc (shared with your social circle's other parents, of course), so it can continue being updated as needed. Keep it simple and do what works for your social circle!
