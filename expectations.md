# Social Circle Expectations
The parents within the social circle should all agree that coordination and open communication is going to be more important than privacy in some cases. For example, communicating when you go on vacation. **Trust, openness, and honesty within the social circle is paramount!** It will be up to you as a parent in your social circle to use your best judgement and common sense with regards to these expectations and communication with other parents in your social circle.  

**Remember, the goal is to keep the social circle as healthy as possible while allowing the kids in the social circle to enjoy each other's company!**  

1. Kids within a social circle do not need to physically distance.
1. Before eating, kids need to wash their hands with soap for at least 20 seconds. Use paper towels to dry.
1. Parents within a social circle should continue practicing physical distancing (~6ft)
1. Between parents of the social circle, establish communication mechanism (e.g. phone/email/text/facebook messenger/etc).
1. Within the social circle, take advantage of shared calendars like the <a href="https://childcarecoop.org/">CCCC</a> or Google Calendars to schedule shared events.
1. Communication is recommended with your social circle's parents when any of the following examples occur (there might be more your social circle agrees upon):
    * Leave your home where you will be in close contact with anyone outside your social circle (e.g. extended family).
    * Have outside your home stay with you in your home (e.g. family coming to visit).
    * Participating in any activities outside of your home where social distancing is not possible (e.g. summer camps, gym group activites, etc.).
    * Change in school situation for one or more kids (e.g. moving from online -> physically at the school).
1. ... More are coming!
